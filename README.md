## waitress

### installation

In order to install waitress, simply paste the following into the ubuntu console (you might want to use sudo): `(apt-get install git && git clone https://github.com/magicwrites/waitress waitress && . /waitress/start.sh)`, and visit `localhost:8200`, or enter through the publicly available IP of your server!

Console is cool, but automation is better :-)
